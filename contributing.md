## Contributing to Micody

First off, **thank you for your time!** This is such a great way to learn together.
By participating, you agree to abide by our project’s **Code of Conduct**. (Be nice, respectful, and don’t hack me :D)

---

### How it works

Every week, I’ll add a fun project to do—just for fun! Feel free to pick any week that speaks to you. You can contribute anytime.

---

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **“Fork”** button at the top-right corner of this page.
This will create a copy of this project in your own GitHub account.

---

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Go to your forked repository on GitHub, click the green **“Code”** button, and copy the URL.

Then, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone "url-you-just-copied"
```

This will download the project to your local computer.

---

### 3. Create a New Branch

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd week01
```

Now, create a new branch for your changes. It’s good practice to name your branch something descriptive, like `add-your-name`:

```bash
git checkout -b add-your-name
```

---

### 4. Add Your Contribution

The fun part! Each week, there’s a README file—check it out and follow the instructions to add your contribution.

---

### 5. Open a Pull Request (when you’re done)

Go back to your forked repository on GitHub.
You should see a **“Compare & pull request”** button—click it!

Add a title and a short description, then click **“Create pull request”**.

---

🎉 **That’s it!**
You’ve successfully made your first open-source contribution.
We’ll review your pull request soon and merge it.

Thank you for being part of our community ❤️
