## ðŸŒ¸ Click-A-Flower

A first three.js project. Just click anywhere to make some flowers bloom :) 

![Click-A-Flower Demo](flower/clickaflo.gif)

### Tech Stack

  * **Three.js:** For all the 3D rendering and magic\! âœ¨
  * **Vite:** A super-fast tool to run a local development server.



### How to Run It

To get this running on your computer, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Then, follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  **Clone the project:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tiaL-ops/detox.git
    cd flower
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the server:**

    ```bash
    npx vite
    ```

4.  **Open in your browser:** Your terminal will show you a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open that link in your browser and start clicking\!



### Your Turn\!

This project is a sandbox for you to play in. Try making some changes\!

  * **Change the Flower:** Can you make every new flower a completely random color? What about changing the shape from a sphere to a box?
  * **Add More Animation:** Can you make the flowers sway gently back and forth after they finish growing?
  * **Play with Physics:** How would you make the flowers start falling with gravity a few seconds after they appear? :)

Have fun creating\!
